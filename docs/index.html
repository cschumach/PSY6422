<h1>IEM Katowice 2020 Tournament Visualization</h1>
<div id="background" class="section level3">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>IEM (Intel Extreme Masters) Katowice is an international e-sports
tournament held in Katowice, Poland. IEM Katowice stands out among other
e-sport tournaments due to its prize pool of $500,000, as well as
consistently breaking viewership records for Counter Strike tournaments
with the IEM Katowice 2020 finals peaking at over 1 million viewers.
Katowice 2022 has managed to surpass this, with viewership peaking at
1.12 million <strong><a
href="https://www.dexerto.com/csgo/iem-katowice-2022-makes-csgo-history-with-impressive-viewership-figure-1772636/">(Mira,
2022)</a></strong>. IEM Katowice 2020 consisted of 16 professional
Counter Strike teams battling it out over the course of 7 days.</p>
</div>
<div id="counter-strike-global-offensive" class="section level3">
<h3>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
<p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive (abbreviated most times to CSGO) is
a competitive First Person Shooter (FPS) game. Each game consists of up
to 30 rounds, which are played by two teams consisting of five players
each. The winning team is decided by whoever reaches 16 round wins
first. Both teams start on a “side” either as “Terrorists” (T) or
“Counter Terrorists” (CT), which they play until half time, where then
both teams are force switched to play the other side (ex. team 1 started
as T, and in half time they are switched to CT). Each side has a
different objective and play style. The T side’s(offensive) objective is
to plant a bomb at one of the two bomb sites on the map before the 1
minute 55 second round timer gets to zero, or eliminate the CT side. The
CT side (defensive) must protect the bombsites, deny bomb planting,
defuse the bomb (if planted), or eliminate the T side to win the
round.</p>
</div>
<div id="current-study" class="section level3">
<h3>Current Study</h3>
<p>This study, seeks to look at the performance of professional players
and their teams across the entire length of the tournament. The
visualization will compare the players <strong>KAST score (Kills,
Assists, Survival, Trades)</strong>. The KAST score provides a more
nuanced look into a players performance, by introducing more factors
dependent on team work (such as time alive and utility assists). KAST is
measured from 0%-100% <strong><a
href="https://www.esportsonly.com/csgo-stats-dont-tell-the-full-story/#:~:text=KAST%20%E2%80%93%20Percentage%20of%20rounds%20in,for%2Dfront%20of%20impactful%20kills.">(De
Carlo, 2019)</a></strong></p>
<p>The next comparison statistic will be <strong>Average Damage Per
Round (ADR)</strong>, as this provides a good gauge of individual match
impact for the player as it averages out the damage which they cause to
the other teams players round by round. This adds insight into
statistics that will not count towards ones KAST, such as utility damage
(grenades), damage from T-Side bomb explosions and, head shots (ex head
shots have a higher damage value attributed to them, thus a player with
a higher ADR will have a higher amount of head shots). This measure is
continuous <strong><a

<div id="data-collection" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>The data sets were acquired via <strong><a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateusdmachado/csgo-professional-matches?resource=download">Kaggle</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-used" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Used</h3>
<p>The data set which was chosen for analysis was player data across
tournaments.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>In order to make extract only statistics from IEM Katowice 2020, the
initial data frame was filtered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we specifically look at the performance of the two
finalist teams (Natus Vincere and G2) and see how they compared to the
other participants. In order to do this, we filtered matches in which
the team was Natus or G2 and the opponent was either Natus or G2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#filtering teams and adding players to track the teams and the matches who ended up in the finals
dfnaviP &lt;- dfpkato%&gt;%filter(team == &quot;Natus Vincere&quot; | team == &quot;G2&quot; | 
                      opponent == &quot;Natus Vincere&quot; | opponent == &quot;G2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We were also curious about player performance across all teams, so we
arranged the players by teams.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#arranging entire tournament into groups by team for ease of interpretation

katoPRGT &lt;- dfpkato %&gt;% group_by(team) %&gt;% arrange(team)</code></pre>
<p>After this, we wanted to visualize the wins and losses of players
throughout the tournament. Unfortunately, this was in another data set
included from the initial kaggle download which focused on team
results.This data set could not be simply added to the player statistics
due to formatting and coding differences.</p>

<p>In order to get around this we took the same steps with the player
data, and filtered and arranged the data to only Katowice 2020.</p>

<h3>Missing Data</h3>
<p>After finishing the initial data clearing and filtering, it was noted
that the initial data set which was imported did not contain the full
match data for IEM Katowice 2020. In order to remedy this the data
frame; katoPRGT (the filtered and cleaned data set) was opened, and the
missing data was imputed from <a
href="https://www.hltv.org/results?event=4901">HLTV.org</a>. The new
data set has been uploaded to <a
href="https://github.com/cschumach/csgokatowiceplayerdata">github</a>
for replicability.</p>
<p>The data set was then imported back into R Studio and named
fullkatoplayerdf and then; based on the previous exploration of the data
with differnt filters, it was decided to use a filter to track the teams
Natus Vincere and G2 (the two finalists) as well as their opponents to
reduce amount of data points on the plot. The data set was then arranged
by date in order to decrease rendering times for the creation of the
animation.</p>

<h3>Visualization Animation Summary</h3>
<p>This animation adds a new dimension to the original plot and helps
tell the story of Natus Vincere and G2’s journey to the finals. This
visualization shows the variations in the players skill (each data
point) and the team performance based on each date of the tournament. It
provides an interesting insight into what factors (although only two)
may contribute to a higher win rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>The non animated visualization provided a solid look into the
performance of the players and teams. It provides a good view of the
overall performance of teams within the tournament, as it shows losing
and winning teams scores on one plot. Furthermore, this visualization
provides insight into how individual play style may effect win chance.
Players on teams such as FaZe and Liquid have mid to high levels of ADR
yet, lower and less consistency in overall KAST scores compared to
players on Natus Vincere and G2.</p>
<p>The animated version works well in tandem with the non animated
version as well as a standalone to further show the scores updating for
each date of the tournament adding another dimension to the original non
animated plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-direction" class="section level3">
<h3>Future Direction</h3>
<p>Due to the complexity and sheer amount of variables which can
influence a team’s win rate and player skill, it would be extremely
interesting to conduct structural equation modeling on more variables
inherent to the player, such as reaction time, experience, map knowledge
and team work. Another possibility, would be run mixed effect models on
the data, in order to work out win chance in order to train machine
learning models to predict match outcomes.</p>
