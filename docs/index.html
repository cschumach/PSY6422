<h1>IEM Katowice 2020 Tournament Visualization</h1>
<div id="background" class="section level3">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>IEM (Intel Extreme Masters) Katowice is an international e-sports
tournament held in Katowice, Poland. IEM Katowice stands out among other
e-sport tournaments due to its prize pool of $500,000, as well as
consistently breaking viewership records for Counter Strike tournaments
with the IEM Katowice 2020 finals peaking at over 1 million viewers.
Katowice 2022 has managed to surpass this, with viewership peaking at
1.12 million <strong><a
href="https://www.dexerto.com/csgo/iem-katowice-2022-makes-csgo-history-with-impressive-viewership-figure-1772636/">(Mira,
2022)</a></strong>. IEM Katowice 2020 consisted of 16 professional
Counter Strike teams battling it out over the course of 7 days.</p>
</div>
<div id="counter-strike-global-offensive" class="section level3">
<h3>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
<p>Counter Strike: Global Offensive (abbreviated most times to CSGO) is
a competitive First Person Shooter (FPS) game. Each game consists of up
to 30 rounds, which are played by two teams consisting of five players
each. The winning team is decided by whoever reaches 16 round wins
first. Both teams start on a “side” either as “Terrorists” (T) or
“Counter Terrorists” (CT), which they play until half time, where then
both teams are force switched to play the other side (ex. team 1 started
as T, and in half time they are switched to CT). Each side has a
different objective and play style. The T side’s(offensive) objective is
to plant a bomb at one of the two bomb sites on the map before the 1
minute 55 second round timer gets to zero, or eliminate the CT side. The
CT side (defensive) must protect the bombsites, deny bomb planting,
defuse the bomb (if planted), or eliminate the T side to win the
round.</p>

<div id="current-study-objective" class="section level3">
<h3>Current Study Objective</h3>
<p>This study, seeks to look at the performance of professional players
and their teams across the entire length of the tournament. The
visualization will compare the players <strong>KAST score (Kills,
Assists, Survival, Trades)</strong>. The KAST score provides a more
nuanced look into a players performance, by introducing more factors
dependent on team work (such as time alive and utility assists). KAST is
measured from 0%-100% <strong><a
href="https://www.esportsonly.com/csgo-stats-dont-tell-the-full-story/#:~:text=KAST%20%E2%80%93%20Percentage%20of%20rounds%20in,for%2Dfront%20of%20impactful%20kills.">(De
Carlo, 2019)</a></strong></p>
<p>The next comparison statistic will be <strong>Average Damage Per
Round (ADR)</strong>, as this provides a good gauge of individual match
impact for the player as it averages out the damage which they cause to
the other teams players round by round. This adds insight into
statistics that will not count towards a players KAST, such as utility
damage (grenades), damage from T-Side bomb explosions and, head shots
(ex head shots have a higher damage value attributed to them, thus a
player with a higher ADR will have a higher amount of head shots). This
measure is continuous <strong><a

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>In order to make extract only statistics from IEM Katowice 2020, the
initial data frame was filtered. The goal of this stage was to not only
clean the data, but investigate would data would provide an interesting
visualization.</p>
<p>First the performance of the two finalist teams (Natus Vincere and
G2) was looked at to see how they compared to the other participants. In
order to do this, we filtered matches in which the team was Natus or G2
and the opponent was either Natus or G2.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#filtering teams and adding players to track the teams and the matches who ended up in the finals

                      opponent == &quot;Natus Vincere&quot; | opponent == &quot;G2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We were also curious about player performance across all teams, so
the players were arranged by teams.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#arranging entire tournament into groups by team for ease of interpretation

<p>After this, we wanted to add another dimension to the plot by
visualizing the wins and losses of players throughout the tournament.
Unfortunately, this was in another data set included from the initial
kaggle download which focused on team results.This data set could not be
simply added to the player statistics due to formatting and coding
differences.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Part 2: Missing Data</h3>
<p>After finishing the initial data clearing and filtering, it was noted
that the initial data set which was imported did not contain the full
match data for IEM Katowice 2020. In order to remedy this the data
frame; katoPRGT (the filtered and cleaned data set) was opened, and the
missing data was imputed from <a

data set has been uploaded to <a

for replicability.</p>
<p>The data set was then imported back into R Studio and named
fullkatoplayerdf and then; based on the previous exploration of the data
with different filters, it was decided to track the teams Natus Vincere
and G2 (the two finalists) as well as their opponents to reduce amount
of data points on the plot. The data set was then arranged by date in
order to decrease rendering times for the creation of the animation.</p>

<h3>Visualization Animation Summary</h3>
<p>This animation adds a new dimension to the original plot and helps
tell the story of Natus Vincere and G2’s journey to the finals. This
visualization shows the variations in the players skill (each data
point) and the team performance based on each date of the tournament. It
provides an interesting insight into what factors (although only two)
may contribute to a higher win rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>The non animated visualization provided a solid look into the
performance of the players and teams. It provides a good view of the
overall performance of teams within the tournament, as it shows losing
and winning teams scores on one plot. Furthermore, this visualization
provides insight into how individual play style may effect win chance.
Players on teams such as FaZe and Liquid have mid to high levels of ADR
yet, lower and less consistency in overall KAST scores compared to
players on Natus Vincere and G2.</p>
<p>The animated version works well in tandem with the non animated
version as well as a standalone to further show the scores updating for
each date of the tournament adding another dimension to the original non
animated plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="constraints" class="section level3">
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>There were several constraints throughout this project, the first was
a lack of meaningful and in depth statistics on professional CSGO
players, while ADR and KAST serve as decent measure of skill, statistics
such as reaction time and utility damage would of made for a more in
depth visualization and a new dimension to analyze. Furthermore, there
is a lack of professional CSGO data sets available. This may be due to
third party constraints on Web scraping as the main CSGO statistics
provider(HLTV) has set up measures against it; requiring external
programs. Another constraint is the use of an animated plot, as the
knitr could not read or load a .gif file or an animation to github.io or
pdf. Future iterations will utilize shiny to circumvent this issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-direction" class="section level3">
<h3>Future Direction</h3>
<p>Due to the complexity and sheer amount of variables which can
influence a team’s win rate and player skill, it would be extremely
interesting to conduct structural equation modeling on more variables
inherent to the player, such as reaction time, experience, map
knowledge, movement and, team work. Another possibility, would be run
mixed effect models on the data, in order to work out win chance in
order to train machine learning models to predict match outcomes.</p>
